## Main Objective
How can we test and determine that one software is better than another? What does it mean to be better in the context of usability? This is a challenging question. However, one approach we can take is to compare the user-friendliness, intuitiveness, practicality, and ease of use of the software. This involves gathering subjective feedback and conducting tests with a random sample of people who try both applications to complete certain tasks. Which app has a higher success rate in task completion? Which app allows tasks to be performed more quickly? These are the questions this study aims to answer.
